# Predicting-stocks
Here are the results I used to predict stocks. I was using a CNN and a Transformer to try predicitng stocks.
Unfortunately I found the CNN model works better than the Transformer model. However, they both get results below 70%.
I will need a new computer to proccess more data to increase the accuracy. I am using 100 GB of data to train these models
